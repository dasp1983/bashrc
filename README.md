## About:

The bash.bashrc system-wide configuration file will add a few things to the command prompt.  
The neofetch.sh will add neofetch to the motd.

Mainly:

- A smile that changes depending if a command was executed or not.
- The local time in the format HH:mm:ss.
- The user logged in at the moment.
- The short hostname of the machine.
- The working directory.
- The amount of jobs in the background.
- The amount of terminal multiplexer open.
